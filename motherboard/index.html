<img class="videoimg" src ="../images/img_mbos.jpg" ><br /><br />

The Motherboard of Shame got its start in 2001, when a new Geek Squad Agent broke a component on a client's computer. He was pretty sure he was going to be fired for this. Apprehensively, he told his manager, who laughed: <br /><br />
"Agent, you're not really a part of the Geek Squad until you've broken something," he said. "Because it is only then that you learn the value of taking your time to do the job right, and to be careful when working on equipment." He then called the client, and explained what happened.  <br /><br />
The manager told the client that we would replace the broken part free of charge, and do all the work the machine was originally checked in for free. The client loved us, and thanked the Agent profusely.  <br /><br />
The Agent (relieved he was still employed) decided to show what he learned. Taking the old motherboard he had broken, he used White-Out to make a big letter "S" on the motherboard. The first MBoS was born.  <br /><br />
Attaching audio connecting wires to the sides, he fashioned a harness, and wore the motherboard the rest of the day, a tongue-in-cheek recognition of the lesson learned. To this day, the legend of the "Motherboard of Shame" has grown, and copies of it have sprung up wherever an Agent has to learn the lesson the hard way.  <br /><br />
It is a lasting symbol of our dedication to learning from our mistakes, taking care of the client at all times, and a gentle way to poke fun at ourselves in the process. When an Agent breaks something now, they wear the motherboard all day long, even when serving clients. (Usually an Agent only has to wear this board ONCE.)
