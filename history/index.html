The Geek Squad is incorporated with $200, a mountain bike, and a cell phone. Robert did not want to be the CEO of a one man company, so he chooses the title of Chief Inspector. <br /><br />
As the company grew quickly, eventually it became time to retire the bike. The first vehicle is acquired, the 1958 Simca Aronde 1300 Elysée. This was Robert’s first form of advertising: nothing but the car and the logo.<br /><br />

<img class="videoimg" src ="../images/img_beetle.png" ><br /><br />
Geek Squad started becoming old car repair instead of computer repair. Slowly over the next 4 years, the classic Geekmobiles were retired. Stepping into their place as official Geekmobiles? The VW Beetle. (Note: Not the geek car or the bug. It’s ALWAYS referred to as the Geekmobile.)<br /><br />
